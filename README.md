# Prerequisites
- `git`
- `build-essential`
- `cmake`
- `gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu` (ubuntu) / `riscv64-gnu-toolchain-glibc-bin` (arch)
- `python3`
- `picocom`
## For RISC-V PC port
If you don't know what this is, you don't need this.
- `mtools`
- `swig`
- `gptfdisk`



# Build system
The build system is based on Makefiles and CMake.
The following commands can be used to perform relevant actions:

To select target platform, choose one of:
- `make config` (manual configuration)
- `make hh24_defconfig` (HackerHotel 2024 badge)
- `make why2025_defconfig` (WHY2025 badge)

To build: `make build`

To remove build files: `make clean`

To flash to an ESP: `make flash`

To open picocom: `make monitor`

To build, flash and open picocom: `make` or `make all`

To check code style: `make clang-format-check` (code formatting) and `make clang-tidy-check` (programming guidelines)

Build artifacts will be put into the `kernel/firmware` folder once the project was successfully built.
