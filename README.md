# Contributing
We are an open-source project, so we can always use more hands!
If you're new to this project and want to help, message us:
- [RobotMan2412](https://t.me/robotman2412) on telegram
- [Badge.team](https://t.me/+StQpEWyhnb96Y88p) telegram group

After that, see [Project structure](./docs/project_structure.md) for reference about how this project works.



# Prerequisites
To be able build the project, we need to install tools and a compiler required for RISCV architecture.

### On ubuntu, run:
```sh
sudo apt install -y gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu build-essential git picocom cmake python3
```
Above command installs all the tools and compiler listed below.

### Tools:
- git
- build-essential
- cmake
- python3
- picocom

### RISCV compiler:
- A RISC-V toolchain, one of:
    - [BadgerOS buildroot](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2025-badgeros-buildroot), preferably riscv64
    - `gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu` (ubuntu) / `riscv64-gnu-toolchain-glibc-bin` (arch)


## For RISC-V PC port
If you don't know what this is, you don't need this. All of:
- mtools
- swig
- gptfdisk



# Build system
The build system is based on Makefiles and CMake.
The following commands can be used to perform relevant actions:

To select target platform, choose one of:
- `make config` (manual configuration)
- `make hh24_defconfig` (HackerHotel 2024 badge)
- `make why2025_defconfig` (WHY2025 badge)
- `make unmatched_defconfig` (RISC-V PC port)


**Navigate to the project directory:** `cd /path/to/BadgerOS`
    
**1. To build, run:** `make build`
    
**2. To remove build files, run:** `make clean`

**3. To flash to an ESP, run:** `make flash`

**4. To open picocom, run:** `make monitor`

**5. To build, flash and open picocom, run:** `make` or `make all`

To check code style: `make clang-format-check` (code formatting) and `make clang-tidy-check` (programming guidelines)

Build artifacts will be put into the `kernel/firmware` folder once the project was successfully built.
